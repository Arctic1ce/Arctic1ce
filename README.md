Hi, I'm Artin Davari, and I am currently a Computer Science student at Cal Poly SLO. I am interested in computer software and hardware,
and like to make unique and interesting projects.

Currently I have completed the following projects:
- Coding a Linux based operating system
- Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
- Discord bot using Python
