Hi, I'm Artin Davari, and I am currently an Electrical Engineering student at Cal Poly SLO. I am interested in computer hardware and software,
and like to make unique and interesting projects.

Currently I have completed the following projects:
- Coding a Linux based operating system
- Discord bot using Python
